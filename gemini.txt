UPLOADED	Indicates the file is uploaded by the user.
GENERATED	Indicates the file is generated by Google.
Status
The Status type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by gRPC. Each Status message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the API Design Guide.

Fields
code
integer
The status code, which should be an enum value of google.rpc.Code.

details[]
object

An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field "@type" contains a URI identifying the type. Example: { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" }.

JSON representation
{
  "code": integer,
  "message": string,
