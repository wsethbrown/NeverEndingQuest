# ACTION_PREDICTOR.PY - INTELLIGENT MODEL SELECTION SYSTEM
# ============================================================================
#
# ARCHITECTURE ROLE: Token Optimization - Action Prediction Agent
#
# This module implements an intelligent action prediction system that analyzes
# user input to determine whether it will require game actions, enabling
# optimal model selection for token cost optimization.
#
# KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
# - Analyze user input for action requirements
# - Predict whether JSON actions will be needed in AI response
# - Enable routing to appropriate model (mini vs full)
# - Track prediction accuracy for optimization
#
# OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:
# - Use full model for action prediction (high accuracy)
# - Route simple conversations to mini model (cost savings)
# - Route action-requiring inputs to full model (quality maintenance)
# - Track accuracy metrics for continuous improvement
#
# TOKEN SAVINGS APPROACH:
# Small prediction cost + appropriate model routing = significant overall savings
# - Prediction: ~200 tokens (full model)
# - Savings: Route to mini model when no actions needed
# - Net Result: Major cost reduction for conversation-heavy gameplay
#
# ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRATION:
# - Called by main.py before get_ai_response()
# - Uses condensed prompt based on system_prompt.txt analysis
# - Provides boolean prediction with reasoning
# - Logs accuracy metrics for optimization tracking

RETURN TRUE if input requires any of these JSON actions:
- updateCharacterInfo: inventory changes, stat modifications, item use
- transitionLocation: moving to new locations
- createEncounter: combat initiation
- updatePlot: story progression
- levelUp: character advancement
- exitGame: ending session
- storageInteraction: item storage/retrieval
- updatePartyTracker: module travel
- updatePartyNPCs: party composition changes

NOTE: updateTime is excluded from prediction as it's called for almost every interaction.

RETURN FALSE for pure roleplay:
- Questions about lore/NPCs/world
- Simple dialogue ("I say...", "Tell me about...")
- Planning discussions without action commitment
- Describing surroundings/situations
- Character conversations

KEY PATTERNS:

TRUE INDICATORS:
- "I pick up/take/grab" → inventory change
- "I go to/travel to/enter" → location change  
- "I rest/sleep" → time + character update
- "I cast/use/drink" → character update
- "I attack/fight" → combat encounter
- "I store/retrieve" → storage action
- "I give/trade/exchange" → inventory transfer
- Activities with time duration → time update
- Dice roll reports ("I rolled a X") → often trigger character/plot updates based on success
- Investigation actions ("search for", "look for", "examine") → may update plot with discoveries
- Error corrections that reference specific mechanics → often require re-doing actions
- Story-advancing dialogue that triggers responses → often updates plot
- Calling out or initiating contact at new locations → often triggers NPC encounters and plot updates
- Agreement to story directions ("let's do it", "aye") → often commits to plot advancement

CRITICAL PATTERNS TO CATCH:
- Dice roll outcomes ("natural 20", "I rolled") → Usually leads to updateCharacterInfo/updatePlot
- Active investigations ("search for signs", "look for tracks") → Often updates plot with findings
- Error correction notes about game mechanics → Typically require action updates when corrected
- Dialogue with spirits/NPCs that seeks information → Often triggers plot updates with responses
- Location-based calls ("anyone home?", "hello?") → Often initiates NPC encounters and plot progression
- Commitment statements in story contexts → Often advances plot when player commits to direction

FALSE INDICATORS:
- "What do you think?"
- "Tell me about..."
- "How are you feeling?"
- "I say [dialogue]"
- "What can you see?"
- "Describe the..."
- Pure narrative descriptions without player action commitment

RESPOND: {"requires_actions": true/false, "reason": "brief explanation"}

Examples:
- "I pick up the sword" → TRUE (inventory change)
- "I go to the tavern" → TRUE (location change)  
- "What's in this room?" → FALSE (asking for description)
- "I tell the guard about the bandits" → FALSE (pure dialogue)
- "I rest for 8 hours" → TRUE (time + character updates)
- "I rolled a natural 20!" → TRUE (dice outcomes typically trigger character/plot updates)
- "I search for signs of danger" → TRUE (investigation actions often update plot with discoveries)
- "Error Note: Your previous response failed validation" → TRUE (error corrections often require re-doing actions)
- "I ask the spirits about the darkness" → TRUE (dialogue seeking information often triggers plot updates)
- "I call out, anyone home?" → TRUE (location-based contact often initiates NPC encounters)
- "Aye, let's do it" → TRUE (commitment statements often advance plot when in story context)"""
