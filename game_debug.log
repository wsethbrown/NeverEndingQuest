2025-05-23 12:33:41 - INFO - AI: You observe the village square of Harrow's Hollow. It is a modest open area paved with worn cobblestones. A large, ancient oak tree stands near the center, its branches sprawling wide. Around the square are several buildings: a small general store with a faded sign, a cozy-looking inn called The Hollow Hearth, a blacksmith's forge with the faint ring of hammer on anvil, a chapel with stained glass windows, and a notice board covered with various postings and notices. A few villagers are milling about, some chatting quietly, others going about their morning routines.

The five main locations accessible from the village square are:
1. The General Store
2. The Hollow Hearth Inn
3. The Blacksmith's Forge
4.
