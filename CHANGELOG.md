## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-20

### Changed
- **Major Codebase Reorganization** for better maintainability:
  - All Python modules organized into logical directories:
    - `core/` - Core game engine (ai, generators, managers, validation)
    - `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
    - `updates/` - State update modules
    - `web/` - Web interface
  - Module builder moved to `core/generators/module_builder.py`
  - Conversation history files moved to `modules/conversation_history/`
  - Updated all import paths throughout the codebase (100% import success)
  - Fixed 47+ import issues across 22 files
  - Added comprehensive import testing tools

### Added
- AI Autonomous Module Creation system:
  - AI DM can create new modules when current adventures are complete
  - Narrative-driven module generation from rich text descriptions
  - AI parsing of embedded parameters (areas, locations, level ranges)
  - Fully agentic system - AI controls all aspects of module creation
  - Conditional prompt injection only when module completion detected
- New `createNewModule` action for AI DM
- Enhanced `module_builder.py` with `ai_driven_module_creation` function
- AI narrative parser for extracting module parameters from prose
- Module creation prompt that guides contextual adventure generation
- Interactive tabs in the web interface for viewing player data:
  - Inventory tab showing equipment, weapons, and currency
  - Character Stats tab displaying basic info, combat stats, and abilities
  - NPCs tab listing party NPCs with their current status
- Auto-refresh of tab data every 5 seconds
- Socket.IO handlers for fetching character data from JSON files
- Responsive styling for tabbed interface with dark theme

### Fixed
- Web interface output routing to properly separate game narration and debug information
- Only "Dungeon Master:" messages appear in the game output panel
- All other output (DEBUG, ERROR, system messages, etc.) now goes to the debug panel
- Fixed issue where DM dialogue containing quotes or colons was incorrectly split between panels
- Improved detection of player status lines vs. DM content to prevent incorrect panel routing

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-17

### Added
- New `generate_prerolls.py` module that pre-generates dice rolls for all combat actions, preventing the LLM from deciding roll outcomes
- Explicit character type labeling in combat (PLAYER, NPC, ENEMY) for clearer differentiation
- Import for `generate_prerolls` function in `combat_manager.py`
- Preroll text generation before each combat round with:
  - Attack rolls
  - Damage rolls (using proper damage dice from creature stats)
  - Saving throw rolls
  - Ability check rolls
  - Clear labeling of creature types and relationships
- Web-based interface for the game with Flask and SocketIO:
  - Separate panels for game output and debug information
  - Real-time updates using WebSockets
  - Automatic browser launch when starting the game
  - Professional dark theme UI
  - Input handling through web interface
- `web_interface.py` - Flask server with SocketIO for real-time communication
- `templates/game_interface.html` - Modern web UI with split panel design
- `run_web.py` - Simple launcher script that starts the web interface

### Changed
- Combat AI no longer determines dice roll outcomes - all rolls are pre-generated
- Enhanced creature type identification with explicit labels:
  - PLAYER CHARACTER: Controlled by the human player
  - NPC: Friendly non-player character allied with the player
  - ENEMY: Hostile monster fighting against the player
- Updated combat prompts to include pre-generated rolls for each round
- Updated `requirements.txt` to include Flask and SocketIO dependencies

### Improved
- Fairness of combat by removing AI bias in dice rolling
- Transparency of combat mechanics with explicit pre-rolled values
- Clarity of character roles and allegiances in combat encounters
- User experience with a modern web interface instead of terminal-only output

### Fixed
- Previously fixed XP calculation path issue for monster files
- Previously fixed .gitignore to exclude runtime and debug files
