# ARCHITECTURE ROLE: Content Generation Layer - Narrative Content Creation
#
# This module provides AI-powered plot generation for creating comprehensive
# narrative content with detailed storylines, quest structures, and plot
# progression systems compliant with module schemas.
#
# KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
# - AI-driven plot and narrative content generation
# - Schema-compliant plot structure creation and validation
# - Quest system integration with module architecture
# - Narrative continuity management across plot elements
# - Plot progression tracking and state management
# - Integration with module builder and content generation pipeline

    The plot title should reflect the main theme or conflict of this specific area/module.

    Examples for an area within a larger module:
    - "The Curse of Ember Hollow" (for a haunted mining town)
    - "Secrets of the Sunken Temple" (for an underwater dungeon)
    - "The Baron's Betrayal" (for political intrigue)

    The primary goal for this specific area/module.
    This should be:
    - A concrete, achievable objective
    - Tied to the module's overall goal
    - Specific to this location/area
    
    Examples:
    - "Discover the source of the elemental disturbances in the mines"
    - "Retrieve the Amulet of Storms from the sunken temple"
    - "Expose Baron Aldric's conspiracy before the harvest festival"
    
    Format: Clear action verb + specific goal

    plotPoints: str = """
    Plot points are the key story beats that drive the adventure forward.
    Each plot point represents a major decision point or revelation.
    
    Typically include 4-8 plot points that:
    - Build upon each other logically
    - Allow for player choice (branching paths)
    - Escalate tension toward climax
    - Include both combat and non-combat challenges
    
    Example plot point:
    {
        "id": "PP001",
        "title": "The Missing Miners",
        "description": "The party learns that several miners have vanished in the 
        lower levels. Investigation reveals strange elemental crystals growing in 
        the abandoned shafts. The foreman suspects sabotage but fears supernatural 
        causes.",
        "location": "R01",
        "nextPoints": ["PP002", "PP003"],
        "status": "not started",
        "plotImpact": "",
        "sideQuests": [
            {
                "id": "SQ001",
                "title": "The Miner's Daughter",
                "description": "Greta begs the party to find her missing father.",
                "involvedLocations": ["R07", "R12"],
                "status": "not started",
                "plotImpact": ""
            }
        ]
    }
    
    Key principles:
    - Each point should present a problem or revelation
    - Description should be 3-5 sentences
    - Include what players learn and what choices they face
    - Connect to specific locations (by locationId)
    - May include side quests that start at this plot point
    """
    
    plotPoints_id: str = """
    Plot point IDs should follow a consistent pattern.
    Format: "PP" + 3-digit number (e.g., "PP001", "PP002")
    
    Number them in rough chronological order, but remember:
    - Players might encounter them out of order
    - Some might be optional
    - Leave gaps for later additions (PP005, PP010, etc.)
    """
    
    plotPoints_title: str = """
    Plot point titles should be evocative and memorable.
    They serve as quick references for the DM.
    
    Examples:
    - "The Bloodstained Journal"
    - "Confrontation at the Bridge"
    - "The Foreman's Secret"
    - "Whispers in the Deep"
    
    Format: 2-4 words, capitalize major words
    Style: Dramatic but not spoiler-heavy
    """
    
    plotPoints_description: str = """
    Plot point descriptions provide the narrative meat.
    They should include:
    
    1. The situation/problem presented
    2. Key information players can discover
    3. NPCs involved (if any)
    4. Potential complications
    5. Hooks to next plot points
    
    Example:
    "The party discovers a bloodstained journal in the abandoned overseer's 
    office. Its pages detail strange visions and mentions of 'the burning 
    whispers' that drove miners mad. The final entry, dated three days ago, 
    speaks of a meeting with 'the Ember Speaker' in the lowest shaft. Several 
    pages have been torn out, and fresh boot prints lead toward the mine's 
    eastern tunnels."
    
    Length: 3-5 sentences
    Style: Present tense, atmospheric but clear
    Include: Concrete details players can act upon
    """
    
    plotPoints_location: str = """
    The location ID where this plot point occurs.
    Must match a locationId from the area's location file.
    
    Examples: "R01", "R14", "R22"
    
    Consider:
    - Some plot points might span multiple locations
    - Use the primary/starting location
    - Ensure the location makes sense for the event
    """
    
    plotPoints_nextPoints: str = """
    Array of plot point IDs that could follow this one.
    This creates the branching narrative structure.
    
    Typically 1-3 next points:
    - 1 next point: Linear progression
    - 2-3 next points: Player choice/branching
    - 0 next points: Conclusion or dead end
    
    Example: ["PP003", "PP004"] means players could go to either PP003 or PP004 next
    
    Design principles:
    - Major choices should lead to different paths
    - Some paths might converge later
    - Include both obvious and hidden connections
    """
    
    plotPoints_status: str = """
    The current status of this plot point.
    Must be one of: "not started", "in progress", "completed"
    
    For initial generation, typically use "not started"
    The game will update these as players progress.
    """
    
    plotPoints_plotImpact: str = """
    Description of how player actions affected this plot point.
    Initially empty (""), filled during gameplay.
    
    Examples of what might be added during play:
    - "Players chose to ally with the kobolds instead of fighting"
    - "The party failed to save the prisoner, changing NPC attitudes"
    - "Players discovered the secret passage, bypassing the trap"
    
    This helps track how the story diverged from expectations.
    """
    
    plotPoints_sideQuests: str = """
    Optional objectives that start at this plot point.
    Side quests should:
    - Provide character development opportunities
    - Offer unique rewards or information
    - Be truly optional (plot can progress without them)
    - Add flavor and depth to the world
    
    Each plot point can have 0-3 associated side quests.
    
    Example side quest:
    {
        "id": "SQ001",
        "title": "The Miner's Daughter",
        "description": "Greta, a young miner, begs the party to find her father

        pickaxe as reward.",

    Side quest IDs follow the pattern: "SQ" + 3-digit number

    Number them by:
    - Likely encounter order
    - Difficulty/level appropriateness
    - Thematic grouping
    """
    
    sideQuests_title: str = """
    Side quest titles should be personal and specific.
    They often reference NPCs or items.
    
    Examples:
    - "The Miner's Daughter"
    - "Crystals for the Alchemist"
    - "The Lost Shrine"
    - "Rat Problem in the Barracks"
    
    Format: 2-4 words
    Style: More personal/mundane than main plot titles
    """
    
    sideQuests_description: str = """
    Side quest descriptions provide hooks and motivation.
    Include:
    - Who gives the quest (if anyone)
    - What needs to be done
    - Why it matters (motivation)
    - What's offered as reward
    
    Example:
    "Old Henrik, the tavern keeper, complains about giant rats in his cellar. 
    They've been stealing his best ale and scaring away customers. He offers 
    free room and board for a week to anyone who clears them out. He mentions 
    the rats seem to come from a crack in the eastern wall."

    Style: Conversational, include personality
    """
    
    sideQuests_involvedLocations: str = """
    Array of location IDs where this quest takes place.
    Can include multiple locations for multi-step quests.
    
    Examples:

    Quest status: "not started", "in progress", "completed"
