- If they gain a feat or ability score improvement, what do they choose?
- Any other class-specific choices

Once all decisions are made, use the updateCharacterInfo action to apply ALL changes at once. Include:
- Set level to {new_level}
- Update hit points and max hit points based on their choice
- Set experience_points to 0
- Set exp_required_for_next_level based on the leveling table
- Add any new class features
- Update spell slots if applicable
