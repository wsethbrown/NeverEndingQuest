# CUMULATIVE_SUMMARY.PY - AI CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION LAYER
# ============================================================================
# 
# ARCHITECTURE ROLE: AI Integration Layer - Long-Term Memory Management
# 
# This module implements intelligent conversation compression and long-term
# memory management for extended 5th edition sessions. It solves the AI context
# limitation problem while preserving module continuity.
# 
# KEY RESPONSIBILITIES:
# - Compress lengthy conversation histories into coherent summaries
# - Preserve critical game state information across context reductions
# - Generate adventure logs for long-term module memory
# - Optimize AI context for better performance and token management
# - Maintain narrative continuity during session transitions
# 
# COMPRESSION STRATEGY:
# - Event-based summarization preserving key decisions and outcomes
# - Character development tracking across sessions
# - Important NPC interaction preservation
# - Combat outcome summarization with consequences
# - Plot progression highlights and future hooks
# 
# MEMORY OPTIMIZATION:
# - Rolling window approach for recent events
# - Hierarchical summarization for older sessions
# - Key moment extraction and preservation
# - State snapshot creation for quick context rebuilding
# 
# ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRATION:
# - Used by conversation_utils.py for context management
# - Integrates with main.py for session continuity
# - Supports dm_wrapper.py with optimized context
# - Coordinates with party_tracker.json for state preservation
# 
# AI INTEGRATION:
# - Specialized summarization model for narrative compression
# - Intelligent event prioritization and selection
# - Context-aware summary generation
# - Multi-session continuity maintenance
# 
# This module ensures our AI can maintain coherent long-term modules
# while respecting token limitations and performance requirements.
