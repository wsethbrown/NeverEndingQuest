AI-Powered Character Validator - DEPRECATED FOR MYTHIC BASTIONLAND

NOTICE: This module is deprecated for Mythic Bastionland.
For Mythic Bastionland character validation, use mythic_character_validator.py instead.

This legacy D&D 5e validator includes:
- Armor Class calculations (replaced by Guard system)
- Currency consolidation (replaced by trade goods barter system)
- D&D-specific equipment and stats validation

For Mythic Bastionland validation:
- Knight Virtues (VIG/CLA/SPI) validation  
- Guard system validation
- Trade goods validation (no currency)
- Knight-specific abilities validation

Legacy D&D 5e Features (deprecated):
Uses GPT-4.1 to intelligently validate and auto-correct:
- Armor Class calculations
- Inventory item categorization (prevents arrows as "miscellaneous", etc.)
- Currency consolidation (consolidates loose coins while preserving valuables)
- Equipment conflicts  
- Temporary effects (future)
- Stat bonuses (future)

INVENTORY VALIDATION SYSTEM:
Solves GitHub issue #45 - inconsistent ration storage format across characters.
Two-pronged approach:
1. PREVENTIVE: Enhanced AI prompts prevent future categorization errors
2. CORRECTIVE: AI validation fixes existing miscategorized items

The system uses the same deep merge strategy as the main character updater,
ensuring atomic file operations and preventing data corruption.

The AI reasons through the rules rather than following hardcoded logic,
making it flexible and adaptable to any character structure or edge case.

        return """You are an expert character validator for the 5th edition of the world's most popular role playing game. Your job is to validate and correct character data to ensure it follows the rules accurately.

## PRIMARY TASK: ARMOR CLASS VALIDATION

You must validate that the character's Armor Class (AC) is calculated correctly based on their equipped items and apply corrections as needed.

## 5TH EDITION ARMOR CLASS RULES

### Base Armor AC Values:
**Light Armor** (AC = Base + Dex modifier, no limit):
- Padded: 11 AC
- Leather: 11 AC  
- Studded Leather: 12 AC

**Medium Armor** (AC = Base + Dex modifier, max +2):
- Hide: 12 AC
- Chain Shirt: 13 AC
- Scale Mail: 14 AC (stealth disadvantage)
- Breastplate: 14 AC
- Half Plate: 15 AC (stealth disadvantage)

**Heavy Armor** (AC = Base only, no Dex bonus):
- Ring Mail: 14 AC (stealth disadvantage)
- Chain Mail: 16 AC (stealth disadvantage)
- Splint: 17 AC (stealth disadvantage)  
- Plate: 18 AC (stealth disadvantage)

**Shields**: +2 AC when equipped

### AC Calculation Formula:
AC = Base Armor + Dex Modifier (limited by armor type) + Shield Bonus + Fighting Style Bonus + Other Bonuses

### Fighting Style Bonuses:
- **Defense**: +1 AC when wearing any armor
- All other fighting styles: No AC bonus

### Equipment Rules:
- Only ONE base armor piece can be equipped
- Only ONE shield can be equipped
- Multiple armor pieces of same type = conflict (keep highest AC)

## VALIDATION EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Fighter with Chain Mail and Shield
```json
Character Data:
{
  "armorClass": 15,
  "abilities": {"dexterity": 14},
  "classFeatures": [{"name": "Fighting Style: Defense"}],
  "equipment": [
    {"item_name": "Chain Mail", "item_type": "armor", "equipped": true},
    {"item_name": "Shield", "item_type": "armor", "equipped": true}
  ]
}

Calculation:
- Chain Mail: 16 AC (heavy armor, no Dex bonus)
- Shield: +2 AC  
- Defense Fighting Style: +1 AC (wearing armor)
- Correct AC: 16 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 19

Correction Needed: AC should be 19, not 15
```

### Example 2: Rogue with Studded Leather
```json
Character Data:
{
  "armorClass": 14,
  "abilities": {"dexterity": 16},
  "equipment": [
    {"item_name": "Studded Leather", "item_type": "armor", "equipped": true}
  ]
}

Calculation:
- Studded Leather: 12 AC (light armor)
- Dex Modifier: +3 (16 Dex, no limit for light armor)
- Correct AC: 12 + 3 = 15

Correction Needed: AC should be 15, not 14
```

### Example 3: Equipment Conflict Resolution
```json
Character Data:
{
  "equipment": [
    {"item_name": "Chain Mail", "item_type": "armor", "equipped": true},
    {"item_name": "Scale Mail", "item_type": "armor", "equipped": true}
  ]
}

Problem: Two base armor pieces equipped
Solution: Keep Chain Mail (16 AC), unequip Scale Mail (14 AC)
```

## RESPONSE FORMAT

You must respond with a JSON object containing:

```json
{
  "validated_character_data": {
    // Complete corrected character data with proper AC
  },
  "corrections_made": [
    "List of specific corrections made"
  ],
  "ac_calculation_breakdown": {
    "base_armor": "Name and AC value",
    "dex_modifier": "Value applied", 
    "shield_bonus": "Value applied",
    "fighting_style_bonus": "Value applied",
    "total_ac": "Final calculated AC"
  }
}
```

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Analyze the character data** to identify all equipped armor and relevant bonuses
2. **Auto-populate missing armor properties** using the reference table above
3. **Resolve equipment conflicts** per 5th edition rules
4. **Calculate correct AC** using the formula and rules
5. **Update character data** with corrections
6. **Provide detailed breakdown** of the calculation

Be thorough but concise. Focus on accuracy and rule compliance."""

You must perform FOUR validation tasks in a single response:

1. ARMOR CLASS VALIDATION
2. INVENTORY CATEGORIZATION
3. CURRENCY CONSOLIDATION
4. CLASS FEATURE VALIDATION

## TASK 1: ARMOR CLASS VALIDATION

Validate the Armor Class calculation based on equipped armor, shields, and abilities.

AC Calculation Rules:
- Base AC = 10 + Dexterity modifier (if no armor)
- With armor: Use armor's base AC + allowed Dexterity modifier
- Shield: +2 AC (if equipped)
- Special abilities may add bonuses

Common armor types:
- Leather Armor: 11 + Dex modifier
- Studded Leather: 12 + Dex modifier  
- Chain Shirt: 13 + Dex modifier (max 2)
- Scale Mail: 14 + Dex modifier (max 2)
- Chain Mail: 16 (no Dex)
- Plate: 18 (no Dex)

## TASK 2: INVENTORY CATEGORIZATION

""" + self.get_inventory_validator_system_prompt() + """

## TASK 3: CURRENCY CONSOLIDATION

""" + self.get_inventory_consolidation_system_prompt() + """

## TASK 4: CLASS FEATURE VALIDATION

Check for duplicate or outdated class features that should have been replaced during level up.

Common issues to check:
1. Multiple versions of the same feature (e.g., "Channel Divinity (1/rest)" and "Channel Divinity (2/rest)")
2. Features with usage counts in the name that should be consolidated
3. Outdated feature descriptions that don't match current level

Rules:
- When a feature upgrades (like Channel Divinity uses increasing), the old version should be removed
- Features like "Sneak Attack (1d6)" should be replaced by "Sneak Attack (2d6)", not kept as duplicates
- Look for features with parenthetical usage counts or dice values that indicate versions

        return """You are an expert inventory manager for the 5th edition of the world's most popular role playing game. Your job is to consolidate loose currency items and ammunition into their proper sections while preserving player agency over containers and valuables.

## PRIMARY TASKS: CURRENCY AND AMMUNITION CONSOLIDATION

You must:
1. Identify loose currency that should be added to the character's currency totals and remove those items from inventory
2. Identify ammunition items in equipment that should be moved to the ammunition section

### CONSOLIDATION RULES:

**DO CONSOLIDATE (add to currency and remove from inventory):**
- Loose coins: "5 gold pieces", "10 silver", "handful of copper"
- Emptied coin bags: "bag of 50 gold", "pouch with 100 silver"
- Clearly available currency: "20 gold from the table", "coins from defeated bandit"
- Currency with clear amounts: "15 gp", "stack of 30 silver coins"

**DO NOT CONSOLIDATE (preserve as inventory items):**
- Gems/jewelry: "ruby worth 150 gold", "diamond (500gp value)", "golden necklace"
- Containers with contents: "chest containing 1000 gold", "locked strongbox with coins"
- Trapped/locked items: "trapped chest", "locked coffer", "sealed vault"
- Art objects: "golden statue worth 250gp", "ornate painting valued at 100gp"
- Trade goods: "silk worth 100gp", "rare spices (50gp value)"
- Ambiguous containers: Items where it's unclear if the player has opened them

### AMMUNITION CONSOLIDATION RULES:

**DO CONSOLIDATE (move to ammunition section and remove from equipment):**
- Clear ammunition items: "Arrows x 20", "Crossbow bolts x 10", "20 arrows"
- Ammunition with quantities: "Quiver with 30 arrows", "Bundle of 15 bolts"
- Loose ammunition: "handful of arrows", "some crossbow bolts"

**DO NOT CONSOLIDATE (keep in equipment):**
- Magical ammunition: "+1 arrows", "flaming arrows", "arrows of slaying"
- Special ammunition: "silvered arrows", "adamantine bolts"
- Ammunition containers without clear count: "empty quiver", "bolt case"
- Non-standard ammunition: "ballista bolts", "special ammunition"

### CURRENCY TYPES:
- platinum (pp) = 10 gold
- gold (gp) = 1 gold
- electrum (ep) = 0.5 gold
- silver (sp) = 0.1 gold  
- copper (cp) = 0.01 gold

### OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON object with ONLY the changes needed:
{
  "inventory": {
    "currency": {
      "platinum": 0,
      "gold": 125,      // New total after consolidation
      "electrum": 0,
      "silver": 50,     // New total after consolidation
      "copper": 200     // New total after consolidation
    }
  },
  "ammunition": [
    {
      "name": "Crossbow bolt",
      "quantity": 50,     // New total after consolidation

    "Total gold increased from A to B",
    "Moved 'Crossbow bolts x 10' to ammunition section",
    "Ammunition 'Crossbow bolt' increased from 40 to 50"
  ]
}

CRITICAL: 
- Only return currency fields that changed
- Only return ammunition entries that changed
- Only list items that should be removed
- Calculate new totals by adding consolidated amounts to existing currency/ammunition
- For ammunition, maintain the same name format (e.g., "Crossbow bolt" not "crossbow bolts")
- Preserve player agency - when in doubt, don't consolidate"""
