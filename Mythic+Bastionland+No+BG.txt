GETTING STARTED
One player is the Referee. They should read
through to the end of the rules section (p21).
The other players can go straight to the
Knighthood page opposite and need not read
any further unless curious.
START & SCOPE
Every group that sits down to play the game
is different, and you should consider the
Start and Scope of a game before you begin.

GLORY
All Knights seek Glory, that they might one
day be deemed worthy of the City Quest.
GLORY THROUGH MYTHS
When the group feels that a Myth has been
resolved, reaching a conclusion of any type,
all Knights who played a part in that Myth
gain 1 Glory.
GLORY BY OTHER MEANS
In a public duel or joust, Knights may stake
Glory against a willing opponent. The victor
gains 1 Glory, the loser loses 1 Glory.

The Start is the opening situation in which
the players find themselves. The Scope is

Knighthood
You are Knights, united by a common Oath
and visions of the City. You may have
dreams of glory, but every Knight must
accept the risk of death.
The Seers who knighted you have deemed
that you travel as a Company. While some
of you may rest, roam, or die, your collective
journey will be as one.

SQUIRES
Small Companies (2 Knights or fewer) may
give each Knight a Squire. They serve as
apprentices, and are not yet Knights, so
cannot gain Glory or perform Feats.

Every Knight has sworn the Oath:

Basic Rules
SAVES
To pass a Save, roll a d20 equal or below the
relevant Virtue. Failure means negative
consequences, not always a failed action.
VIRTUES
Virtues can be reduced and raised in a
number of ways, but can never go higher
than 19 or lower than 0.
TURNS
A turn is enough time to Move and then
perform an Action, always in that order.
SURPRISE
Players normally take the first turn of
combat, discussing their plan and acting in
any order they wish.
Characters who were not readied for combat
must pass a CLA Save or miss the first turn.
REACTION
Non-player characters react in a way that
feels appropriate for the current context.
When uncertain, a character makes a SPI
Save to avoid an unfavourable reaction.

ATTACKS
Take the Attack dice noted on your
weapon(s), shield, and granted by bonuses.
Go through the following steps in order:
1. All combatants attacking the same target
roll their dice at the same time.
2. If the target or their nearby allies can
Deny (p10) they may use it.
3. Attackers may perform Gambits (p10).
4. Take the highest die remaining.
5. Add any extra Damage from attackers
who are Bolstering the Attack (p10).
6. Subtract the target’s total Armour score.
7. The Attack causes that much Damage.
So a Knight with a mace (d8) and shield (d4)
is aided by an ally with 2 daggers (d6 each).
They roll d8 and d4, and 2d6 respectively.
The dice show 7, 3, 1, and 5. The highest die
is 7. The 5 is spent on a Gambit to Bolster the
Damage to 8. The target has Armour 2 (helm
and shield), reducing the Damage to 6.

Impaired attacks roll d4 only and cannot

may assume control of a Squire or follower.
If Damage reduces the target’s VIG to 0, they
are Slain.

Harm & Scars
VIRTUE LOSS
Virtues may be reduced by means other than
Damage, typically referred to as Virtue Loss.
In addition to the situations listed in the
rules, characters may suffer Virtue Loss as
the cost or consequence of an action. This is
detailed in the Action Procedure (p16).

SCARS
Take the die that caused the Scar and roll it
again, consulting the table below for the
specific Scar caused.

Victims are only Slain or Mortally Wounded
if the Virtue was reduced by Damage, never
as a result of Virtue Loss.

Scars are only gained through real, deadly
combat, not training or bloodless duels.

At VIG 0 you are Exhausted and cannot
Attack if you have moved this turn.
At CLA 0 you are Exposed and treated as
having 0GD.

Virtue Loss through Scars is not Damage, so
cannot Mortally Wound or Slay the victim.

At SPI 0 your attacks are Impaired rolling a
single d4 only.
RECOVERY
Guard is fully restored with just a moment
of peace after the danger has passed.
Fatigue is also removed this way.

Virtues can be fully restored by 3 means:

5

Consuming a specific type of Remedy
Performing a specific Action
Skipping to a new Season

•

4

7

Vigour is restored by consuming Sustenance
or spending a full day in warm hospitality.
Clarity is restored by consuming Stimulant
or receiving guidance from a Seer.
Spirit is restored by consuming Sacrament
or indulging a Passion.
REMEDIES
A single Remedy is a sizeable bundle of
materials and tools. A person or dedicated
beast of burden can only carry one at once.
Using a Remedy requires a whole Phase of
the day, and is more about the ceremonial act
than the material components themselves.
The Virtue is restored before resolving any
Omens or other encounters. A single Remedy
is enough to benefit all company present.

Arms & Goods
TRADE
Only the rich deal in coins. Most trade is an
exchange of raw materials, goods, or service.
Frequent trades often grow into ongoing
pledges of service, cooperation, or protection.

WEARING ARMOUR
One of each armour type (coat, plates, helm,
shield) can be worn at once, combining their
armour scores together. Plates and helm are
generally not worn outside of battle.

Simply, if you hope to trade you should have
a good answer to the question “What can I
offer that they would value?”.

COMMON ARMOUR
Shield: d4, A1 (round, kite, heater)

Common items are widely available.
Uncommon items require a specialist.
Rare items are truly treasured.
WIELDING WEAPONS

People & Realms
SERVICE
Holdings house a range of people who can be
called on for service. The larger the Holding,
the more likely that a particular service is
being offered there.
Many will gladly offer their service to a
Knight, but all have limits, after which they
ask something in return or refuse entirely.
As with trade, the key question comes down
to “What can I offer that they would value?”.
Common services are offered everywhere.
Uncommon services require training.
Rare services require a lifetime dedication.
Roll their Virtues on d12+d6.
COMMON
Servant: 2GD
Single duty with little expertise
Guide: 4GD
Handaxe (d6), javelin (d6), local knowledge
Sentry: 3GD
Billhook (d10 long), little appetite for combat
UNCOMMON
Herbalist: 2GD
Knows treatments, not cures
Soldier-at-Arms: 6GD
A2 (helm, shield)
Spear (d6 hefty), shield (d4), battle worn
Archer: 3GD
Shortbow (d6 long)
RARE
Sage: 2GD
Holds immense knowledge in a particular
area of expertise
Alchemist: 2GD
Creates poisons or quasi-medicinal potions
Sellsword: 7GD

Generally only agrees to fights that they are
confident they can win

REALMS
• The world is fractured into petty Realms,
each ruled from a Seat of Power.
• Smaller Holdings are walled settlements
tended by Vassals, guarded by Knights.
• Most that lies between is wilderness.
MYTHS
• Stories that became truths, or are
destined to come to pass.
• Nobody agrees on the details, but every
version is true in some way.
• There’s no such thing as “just a myth”.
ROLES
• Most fall into one of four roles: Vassal,
Vagabond, Knight, or Seer. A web of
seniority exists within and between each.
• Vassals serve a ruler, typically a Knight,
in return for protection.
• Vagabonds roam, working for and
protecting only themselves.
SEERS
• Those who understand the nature of
Myth enough to glimpse into our future.
• Their visions grant legitimacy and
direction to a Knight’s quest.
• They know when a Squire is ready to
become a Knight, and when a Knight is
ready to seek the City.
KNIGHTS
• Those who take the Oath are held in
esteem, but expectations burden them.
• They rely on their arms, but are expected
to know the customs of peace.
• Usually one Knight holds each title,
passed on in retirement or death.
FAITH
• Some believe there is truth in the sky: the
stars, moon, sun, positions, and motions.
• Some look to nature: the turn of seasons,
the sound of trees, the wisdom of beasts.
• Some believe the sacred stories that
weave into Myths, guiding us to the City.

Sites
A Knight’s journey largely focuses on
travelling great distances to seek the
guidance of Seers and uncover Myths.
However, on occasion there may be the need
to zoom in on a single Hex, or a specific site
within a Hex, in more detail.
Sites can be created as areas that warrant
more detailed exploration, whether ancient
tombs, hostile castles, twisting caverns, or
misty woods spanning the entire Hex.
While they can be plotted out with any
number of traditional methods, this is a
quick Hex-based method.

Refereeing
PRIMACY OF ACTION
Even when using the rules for travel,
exploration, and combat, remember this, the
most important thing:

ACTION PROCEDURE
When the players take action the Referee
works down this list:

Anything too beneficial or too harmful
creates the feeling of an arbitrary world.
Instead, describe something that does at
least one of the following:

FAILURE
When the players fail at a risky action they
might still complete the action, but always
suffer negative consequences:

area and its inhabitants.

Reinforces something that they've
already learned about this place.

PROMPTS
Every Knight and Myth spread has prompts
across its base. These serve as cues for
improvisation as needed. Spark Tables (p22)
are also useful for generating ideas.

IMPACT
Whether a success or a failure, ensure that
the players’ actions have an observable
impact on the world. The best types of impact
have both immediate and lasting
consequences, always moving things forward.
ENDING A SESSION
At the end of each session:

LUCK ROLLS
If you need to consult the whims of fate,
•
make a Luck Roll on a d6. A high roll favours
the players, a low one does not.
•
In general, use these guidelines:

16

LUCK ROLL
Crisis: Something immediately bad.
Problem: Something potentially bad.
Blessing: A welcome result.

Threaten: Create a new problem.
Escalate: Make a problem worse.
Execute: Deliver on a threat.

•

Discuss if it would feel right for a Season
or Age to pass between now and the next
session (p17).
If a Season or Age passes, then follow the
procedure detailed.
Ask the players if they have any plans or
ambitions for the next session. This gives
you a direction for any preparation you do
before then.

Time
Each Day has 3 Phases:
•
•
•

Morning: Sunrise to Noon.
Afternoon: Noon to Sunset.
Night: Sunset to Sunrise.

Each Year has 3 Seasons:

ADVANCING TIME
At the end of each session, or during a
natural break in their journey, the group
decides how much time will reasonably pass:
•
•

None: Pick up where you left off.
Weeks: Continue on to the next
significant seasonal event.
Months: Move to the next Season.
Years: Begin a new Age in Spring.

Travel
Travelling consumes a whole Phase of the
day and uses one of 3 methods:
•
•

OMENS
Each Myth has 6 Omens, listed in the order
in which they are encountered. The first
encounter with a specific Myth is always
Omen 1, the second Omen 2 etc.

Trek: 1 Hex on foot or steed.
Gallop: 2 Hexes on a non-Exhausted
steed. The steed loses d6 VIG.
• Cruise: 3 Hexes by boat, or by steed on a Remember primacy of action (p16). If the

they don’t have to wait for that Omen to

Otherwise all clear.

HOSPITALITY
When sleeping indoors, do not make a
Wilderness Roll. Manners dictate that
hospitality be granted to travelling Knights.
Longer stays warrant a favour in return.
CAMPING
When sleeping outdoors make a Wilderness
Roll as normal, ignoring Landmarks.
Hostile Omens prevent proper sleep, while
others may not occur at all if they are
improbable as nighttime activity.

BARRIERS
Travel through a Barrier is not normally
possible, though locals might know a way.
Attempting to travel through a Barrier
wastes that Phase of the day, but still causes
a Wilderness Roll.
OTHER TRAVELLING TABLES
Travellers who find themselves roaming
without a proper sense of direction, or
shrouded by darkness or mist, must roll
when they try to move to a new Hex.

local mood.

LOCAL MOOD
Occupied by a looming or recent woe.
There is a sense of things in decline.
A fine mood and all seems well enough.

Exploration
THE LAY OF THE LAND
Each Hex is large and diverse, a land within
the land. Some may spend their whole lives
within one. A forest Hex might have cliffs,
streams, clearings, and caves.
Use Spark Tables (p22) and the prompts at
the base of each Knight and Myth spread to
help fill the blanks in your Hexes.
EXPLORATION ACTIONS
When ruling exploration actions, follow the
standard Action Procedure (p16). In
particular, consider whether the action will
take a whole Phase of the day to carry out.
As with other Actions, the players should
know the risks before they commit to it.

GATHERING FOLKLORE
Everybody knows something about Myths.
How much depends on who they are.
Vassals know about their nearest Myth, and
its general direction. If it is adjacent to their
home then they know its precise location.
They know Landmarks in their home and
neighbouring Hexes.
Knights and Vagabonds have roamed
enough to know about a random Myth of the
Realm and its rough direction. They also
know of the nearest Landmark.
All of the above know rumours that warn of
dangers, but not how to avoid or undo them.

Seers know the rules of all Myths, their
secrets, and their locations. They know their
weaknesses, and cures to their maladies.
They know all Landmarks in the Realm.
Even if they fail the Save, the goal might still Such vast knowledge isn’t given freely.
be achievable, but now faces an obstacle, a
hostile encounter, or an additional cost.
For example, take Myth 6, the Goblin.
If the Action calls for a Save the Company
decides who rolls, using their Virtue.

While the cause and consequence of failure
can be personal, they also represent the
whims of nature, bad weather, shifting land.

Omen 2 describes “A lost lad, full of stories.
Claims a little old man called him into the
woods.”

If it is unclear which Virtue to use, consider
the main activity involved in the risky part:

All locals know about children going missing,
and stories of a strange old man in the woods
off to the north-east.

•
•
•

Vigour: Strength or physical stamina.
Clarity: Senses or mental quickness.
Spirit: Social or emotional influence.

SEARCHING
It takes a whole Phase to carry out a surface
level sweep of an entire Hex, thoroughly
search for something known to exist there, or
find a vantage point.

A Seer knows that this is, in fact, the Goblin,
and would know that he can only claim lost
things, unable to steal for himself. They even
know where to find his lair.

VISION
From a vantage point it’s possible to get an
overview of the current Hex and a general
sense of what lies in neighbouring hexes, but
not specific details.

19

Dominion
RULING A DOMAIN
In return for pledging loyalty to the Seat of
Power, a Holding might be granted to a
Knight or influential Vassal. This forms a
Domain. Wilderness Hexes and their
Landmarks formally fall under the dominion
of their nearest Holding.

CRISES
Ruling a Domain is an exercise in ongoing
disaster management.
At the start of a Season or when returning
from a long absence, roll:

Courtiers: Commoners with lesser

MUSTERING TROOPS
A typical Seat of Power can muster 3
Warbands, other Holdings 2. The Marshal
determines their training and armament.
TAXES, TITHES, & LEVIES
Standard collections (p17) keep the Domain
running without too much strain. A Steward
can squeeze more from their Vassals for a
war or great project, but must roll:

2-3
4-6

SUCCESSION
Typically a ruler names their successor,
though some Realms defer the decision to a
conclave of Seers or a group of specially
chosen Knights-Elector.
Whoever the successor, they are sure to face
at least some resistance, and should quickly
establish their own authority.

INCREASED COLLECTIONS
Immediate misrule.
Your coffers are filled, but take a Crisis.
The Vassals pay willingly, mostly.

COURTLY CONFLICT
Courtiers breed problems, especially when
they hold leverage over their ruler, whether
family influence, dark secrets, or military
might. Here a ruler must tread carefully, as
obvious solutions always leave at least one
party feeling mistreated.
Every Season brings some drama. Spark
Tables (p22) can help to describe this.
Roll to see how you’re involved:

DRAMA IN COURT
You are personally involved.
You are involved by association.
You are not involved.

CONQUEST
Knights live between two worlds. One of
rank, oath, and rule of the worthy. The other
of chaos, brutality, and rule of the strong.
Often, having the audacity to seat yourself in
a Holding is enough to make you the ruler.
Holdings and Realms seized by force and left
unchallenged tend to have a period of turmoil
before adapting to the new status quo.
GRAND DESIGNS
Work on existing buildings or infrastructure
is generally completed by the next Season.
New buildings or infrastructure can be
completed in a Season.
Grand projects such as castles and roads
require an entire Age of work.

The majority of any Realm is wilderness, where even rough trails are a rare sight.

Knights

Roll d6 and d12. Read the d6 first. Pages list the d6 in a square, d12 in a pentagon.
Each Knight can be used for a player
character or non-player Knights who are
encountered wandering or ruling.
Generally each player should have a
different type of Knight.
Some Realms refer to Knights by honorific
titles and ranks, others their given name
and home, while most use their full
knightly title or simply “Knight.”

26

This is not an exhaustive list, and even
those listed Knights may differ as the
mantle is passed on.
Each page also includes the Seer who
granted their Knighthood, witnessing the
pledging of their Oath.

Myths

Roll d6 and d12. Read the d6 first. Pages list the d6 in a square, d12 in a pentagon.
Each Myth lists its Omens and the cast of
beings who are associated with it.
Entering or exploring the Myth’s Hex
always reveals its next Omen,
remembering Primacy of Action (p16).
The Hex itself is visually tied to the Myth.

When the group feels that a Myth is
resolved the Knights each gain 1 Glory and
a new Myth replaces it in the next Season.
Myths may appear at odds with their
Realm, such as The Sea in a desert.
Still, these Myths must be brought to pass,
so Realm and Myth can shift as needed.

answering one question on behalf of the
dead each day. At morning, a herd of grey
deer visit the lake to show their respects.

Shadow’s world. Islands in the mist of
time. The mourned past can be seen as

about their work tending to the River.
2. Lost fisherman washed up on the

3. A rocky outcropping, a lone dead tree at
its peak. Three monks seek a blood

4. Pilgrims arguing with a Bridge Knight
chasing a toll. The Knight knows one of
the pilgrims has a coin from the City and
will take it by force if necessary.
5. The River bursts into a new stream. If
travelling, the route is cut off. For the first
few moments, water from the newborn
stream can heal any ailment.

Pack

Woods and moors or paddock and rein
Wolves alone chomp at the chains

Omens

Cast

1. Wailing shepherd. His sheepdogs have
slaughtered their flock and fled. Crows
feast on the gore. His family are hungry.
2. A band of poets and scribes fight among
themselves, unable to speak except
snarling growls. The Pack watch from a
nearby hill, scattering if disturbed. When
they leave, the wanderers’ voices return.
3. A rival fighting the leader. 6 wolves guard
against interruption. They favour the
challenger. The leader is toying with him
and tears his throat when he gets bored.
4. The wind suddenly stops, then the sound
of jaws lapping at air. Then the howl,
rough and screeching. Countless howls
join the call, air completely still. Soon the
howl stops and the wind returns.
5. An important trade road has been
blockaded by savagely torn trees and
heaps of soil wet with blood.
6. The 13 wolf pack howls in their den,
setting their sights on a nearby Dwelling
or Holding, attacking the humans and
their broken beasts in dark or mist.

The sight of the eye opened my own

1. Nothing more than the hollow grunts of
moon toads in the roots. When the
Knights sleep they share a dream of a

wooden wagon carrying a boulder painted
with a spiral eye. It is a peaceful parade,
but they warn the ascent is coming.

sprouts legs and begins to march toward
the nearest Seer, aiming to devour them
for their knowledge before returning to

Knights. They are in the thrall of the Imp,
flying to him after they have drawn blood.

they refuse he attacks with his black fire.

releases the victims when they are

2. A tiny chameleon watches from a crooked
branch. Hisses a warning if anybody
passes near, stirring the Troll in the
nearby trees, fleeing back to its home.
3. A burglar is fleeing from an abandoned
cave, a home carved into the earth.
Clumsy furniture cobbled from rock and
mud. Blood on the ground, smashed
bones, another dead troll limb. The
burglar found nothing of value in there.
4. The Troll drags a dying warhorse back
toward its new cave. A Knight lays dead.
5. Bronze, shimmering pond amongst a bog
of fly-infested reeds. Disturbing the water

lyrics about the Knights, knowing more
than they possibly could. They utterly
ignore the Knights, even if apprehended.
3. In a meadow, a band of drunks are feeding
a bonfire, growing out of control. They
openly praise the Writher Within,
gloating that he’s coming to eat the Seers
and free us from their lies.

Cast

1. On glittering rapids, a shepherd is being

scavenging on beaches.
2. Salty rain batters the land, web-like weed
hanging from the trees. In an abandoned

rises forth, its tide surging out night and
day. Roaring coots honk out in a
deafening protest.
4. The Two-Hearted Knight bellows at the
Sea, trying to repel the water with their
coral ring. They don’t know that they
must be submerged in the water to

the wave has arrived. Saltwater rises
from all water sources, the land is flooded,
and harvest ruined.
6. The wave swells on the horizon, as tall as

Realm then little can survive. After the
devastation the Sea is quelled and

Cast

the next Season arriving early.

defenceless, defeated ironsmith outside
his tiny forge. They claim the tide of

with the highest SPI score. It is imbued
with the power of the upcoming Season,
when it is more potent (2d8).

Cast

1. A cowherd sleeps on a branch. Then, a
rumble in the ground followed by their
cattle stampeding this way.
2. A maze of stony crags. A message carved

Cast

1. On the brink of a disused clay pit, a potter
shapes a bowl, telling a story to the dozen
children gathered to watch. She tells of
the Lion, the king of beasts. No Knight
could slay him, but a potter was his great
enemy. She avoids giving any details.
2. Horse breeders leading a dozen chargers
toward the Seat of Power. They’re
struggling to get the horses moving, as
they’re all bowing toward the Lion’s Hex.
3. An isolated, babbling pond. A pike pokes
its head from the water to cackle at
passers-by. It can’t really speak, but
mimics words it has heard. It shouts “He’s
here for his crown” among the gibberish.
4. All steeds throw riders to the ground
before charging off toward the Seat of
Power to await the Lion’s arrival.
5. The Lion, heading toward the Seat of

In woestich hide and gos’mer lance

Omens

Cast

1. Six carrion storks pick at webbed corpses
of a Knight, a Squire, and steeds.
2. A makeshift trail suddenly gives way to a
wide tunnel network. This labyrinth leads
to the Myth Hex, but the Spider guards it.
3. A skittering shadow in the clouds, then a
blanket of thick webs covers the Company
(VIG Save to break free). Next round, the
Spider attacks, but only wants a snack.
4. The Spider Herald watches over a gloomy
mound, warning passers-by to keep their
distance. The mound conceals a nest of
writhing spider eggs. Any interference
summons the Spider to defend his young.
5. The Spider Herald arrives, beckoning the
Company over. She inquires about their
prowess, and if they seem worthy she
cheerily informs them that they are now
the Prey of the Spider, a great honour.
6. The Spider bursts from the ground. He’s
been tracking the Company and fights
until wounded, when he withdraws
underground to return when fully healed.

Cast

1. The Cloud Hag descends from above,
bombarding the Company with gusts of
wind. She’ll leave when she feels strong.
2. A cauldron under a canopy of knotted
trees. Anything dipped in glows with
darkness. For the rest of the day the

harm you. If living matter touches the

3. The Garden Witch stoops about in the
shrubbery, plucking snails before eating
them. She offers her snails, which allow
the eater to speak with plants briefly.
4. Amid a field of lush growth, a perfect
circle of dead plants. Plants entering the
circle wither and die. The Garden Witch
has planted a saltstone causing this.
5. The wind drops. The Achantrix screeches
that there will be no night today. The next
night phase is treated as day.
6. The Coven fight to the death, nothing able
to quell their hatred for each other. The

threatens any Knights, but blasts off into
the sky if he needs to retreat to his palace.
5. The Lich, as a skull, rests on a heap of
bones before reassembling to a human
form, desiccated skin growing to cover his
bones. Now with a full body he seeks to
return to his palace and rule the Realm.
6. A sky of skull-clouds bellow a new law

end, all who broke the law are struck by a
black bolt (6d12 Damage, ignore Armour).

Omens

Cast

1. Beneath a grey willow, a young man
washes a heap of clothes in a tiny pond.
It’s the cleanest water in the Realm. He
sings a song about “a Knight that fought
death” but forgets most of the words.
2. The Wight rides forth on their ghostly
steed. They shout a challenge to single
combat, the loser allowing the winner to
drive a sword through their heart. The
Wight knows that this won’t kill them.
3. Creaking, gasping breath on the wind.
The Wight hunches among a crown of
jagged rocks. If disturbed they leap upon
their steed and flee in shame.
4. The Wight returns, another challenge of
solo combat. Now the loser must allow the
winner to burn them. The Wight tries to
lose, but even fire does not kill them.
5. An unmarked, recently dug grave. If
disturbed the Wight bursts out and flees.
6. A final challenge from the Wight,
accompanied by a Seer. The Seer
announces they will kill the winner in a
horrible manner (see opposite).

Omens

Cast

1. A wretch pleads for charity. She was a
Knight, sentenced harshly by the Judge.
2. A courtyard in black and white, carved
seats in a circle. Vague voices echo,
arguing, then a loud clap followed by
silence. This place is gone if returned to.
3. Three Sergeants of Law deliver a scroll to
the Knight called for judgement. The
Knight will be retrieved when the time is
right; a horn will be the warning.
4. One of the Knights vanishes into mist,
forced to give witness to the trial of a
Knight that they know. After testifying
they are returned in a swirl of mist.
5. A clear horn is heard across the Realm.
6. The Retriever of Justice comes bounding
on the horizon, roughly dragging the
summoned Knight to court, which has
materialised nearby. The Judge awaits,
able to summon witnesses for or against,
judging whether the Knight has truly
done their best to follow the Oath. At the
next sunset or sunrise she gives her
verdict (see opposite).

sheep. They’re heading to a nearby lake

carves away at the stone with his bare
hands, sculpting beasts. Two such beasts
watch on, eager for a new companion.

six cloud raiders fall from above, landing

that earthly tools cannot harm the Tree.

the Realm. One falls nearby, a pair of
cloud creatures clinging on before

6. With a thunderous creak the Tree begins
to lean. A moment later it falls, followed
by a rain of branches. The Myth Hex and
all adjacent Hexes are devastated,

The

City Quest

For the oath, for the glory, through sorrow and ache
The City, that quest to which no Knight can make
A Company worthy of the City Quest continues their knightly duties as normal, but when
they would encounter an Omen from a random Myth by rolling 1 on the Wilderness Roll,
they instead encounter an Omen from the City Quest.
To determine the Omen, roll d12 and add the number of Omens of the City that the
Company have already encountered, adding 0 if this is their first. In the case of a duplicate
take the next Omen down the list. Treat rolls of higher than 24 as 24 instead.
After encountering Omen 18 or higher the City Quest ends.

Omens
1. A lost traveller in finely cut cloth, armed
with a strange device. He’s desperate to
get back to the City, telling stories of a
place of coloured lights and brick towers.
2. On the horizon, a jagged skyline of towers,
domes, impossible bridges, dotted with
warm light. It fades in the next Phase.
3. Four strange raiders stroll up, mocking
the Knights as primitives. They attempt
to rob anything of value the Knights have.
4. A broken trail appears to have a golden
hue, gradually turning to slabs of
sparkling stone, impossibly smooth. After
a while the road fades back to nothing.
5. The City Knight, returning from the City.
She advises you to turn back.
6. Three great shapes move in the sky,
casting shadows over the land. Like huge,
dark eggs, a growling hum. With a chorus
of bangs they send an explosive barrage
(2d10 blast) down onto the Company
before drifting off to the horizon.
7. A rider in ugly red plate. She claims to be
the Arch-Hellion of Jules, pressing a
claim on the nearest Seat of Power. She is
from the City, but smugly refuses to share
any information about it.
8. A wide tunnel through a sheer cliff face,
the other side visible. Partway through
the tunnel, a rumble, a whistle, a blast of
white smoke. Anyone who doesn’t vacate
the tunnel is struck by an immense force
(3d10), which vanishes before it exits the
other side of the tunnel.
9. Green-grey smoke washes over the land
for the rest of the season. It burns
slightly, but no serious effect.
10. A Warband of Knight-Catchers charge,
aiming to preserve you for display in a
museum that does not exist yet.

172

11. A metal wagon lies in ruin, various
canisters and pipes lie broken within the
wreckage, like nothing you’ve seen before.
Amongst the wreckage, a metal chest
contains a beautiful crystal bottle filled
with fiery liquor, and a pouch of
impossibly clear diamonds.
12. A woman in a black coat, with a broad hat.
She’s a science-mystic, trading wonders
from the City in return for guidance to
mystical places in the Realm.
13. A pottery-like stairway leading downward
in a spiral. A green-tiled tunnel with soft
light, soothing music. The exit leads to a
distant point in the Realm.
14. A wooden case with six rifles (2d10 long)
and a good amount of ammunition.
15. A sponge-like, metallic material has burst
forth from the soil, slowly growing from
beneath. Narrow tunnels lead into a
chamber where ten silver ghouls sleep.
16. A towering, square mountain. The
slightest touch reduces it to rubble,
releasing the brick giant within.
17. Scattered plates and wires. A faint voice
from a blinking light. You may ask the
voice one question, which it will answer
with certainty. It knows everything.
18. An open plain. You are utterly certain
that this is where the City must be built.
19. A vast, empty, glittering castle. The City
will grow from here with the right ruler.
20. The City. A hellish smoke-choked factory.
21. The City. All coloured lights, strange
machines, and discordant music.
22. The stars look closer. You feel a force
drawing you toward them, into the void.
23. A liquid light roars over you. Embrace the
end or abandon your quest.
24.
You see now. The City was a lie.

Gambits can be tricky. You want them to feel

enough to completely resolve the combat.
On a tangent, I like that the Referee gently

Especially early in a campaign it’s useful to
keep the Oath at the forefront of their minds.
Here the Referee offers some examples to Tal
on what the Gambit could do. I’d perhaps
remind them that these examples aren’t a
restrictive list, and they could carry out

The Upper Hand
PLAY

THOUGHTS

Moss and Tal are sparring using wooden
swords (d6 hefty) and light shields (A1). Ref
has ruled that any Damage sustained from
this can be shaken off afterwards.

In combat, sometimes one side has a clear
upper hand. Consider two Knights fighting in
pitch darkness, one with perfect nightvision.

Ref: Okay so you both agree that this is a
duel, right? That means you’ll roll and deal
Damage simultaneously.
Moss: Okay, let’s go.
Both players make a normal Attack to begin
with. Moss rolls 2, Tal 3.
Ref: So you’re both sort of feeling each other
out first, wooden sword clattering against
shield, a few probing jabs. No sharp blade to
worry about, but a wooden sword to the ribs
isn’t a barrel of laughs.
Tal: Hey, Moss, aren’t you scared you’ll fall
in the mud again like when you fought that
brand new Squire?

While these are straightforward, more often
players will try to earn the upper hand.
Gambits are one way to represent this,
especially using Smite or Focus to improve
your chances, but there are other options.
There are various ways do this, and here we
see Tal taking a risk. There are a few ways
this can go. The classic is "roll a Save, if you

At endmost of days, my nothing awaits
No treasure or famehood from seerbound fates
A sorrid life wasted on gutsodden ground
Drowned in pyresmoke of tomorrows unfound

What of the city? What of the call?
Mine ears now ring clearly, unfettered by all
In greyhood those troubles are shed like a blossom
To fall into ground as my deeds go forgotten

208

Yet, more is unmade than my own petty story
Stellestian watchers care nothing for glory
The waters bescattered, the land torn to waste
Sky shriken past me with unearthly haste

Beyond flares of man glow the gleamers o’high
Lanterns as gods that see myth as a lie
I witness the folly of old battles fought
Only stars now, the City is naught
