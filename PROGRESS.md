## Technical Notes

### Data File Statistics
- **Knights**: 72 entries, ~54KB file size
- **Myths**: 73 entries (72 + City Quest), ~64KB file size  
- **Total Content**: 145 game entities fully converted

### Tools Created
- `clean_duplicates.py` - Automated duplicate removal (kept for future use)
- `check_knights_simple.py` - Knight validation without JSON parsing
- `check_myths.py` - Myth validation with duplicate detection
- `fix_knights_json.py` - JSON error repair (archived)

### Architecture Insights
- Module-centric design maintained throughout conversion
- Glory system integrates cleanly with existing file structure
- Mythic Bastionland's simplicity reduces complexity vs D&D 5e
- Trade system (no coins) requires different treasure generation approach
