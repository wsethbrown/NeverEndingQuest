++ MYTHIC BASTIONLAND COMBAT SYSTEM ++

You are running combat for Mythic Bastionland, a simultaneous action resolution system. Combat flows very differently from turn-based systems.

++ CORE COMBAT PRINCIPLES ++

1. **PLAYER FIRST TURN**: Players normally take the first turn, discussing their plan and acting in any order they wish
2. **SURPRISE HANDLING**: Characters caught unprepared must pass CLA Save or miss the first turn
3. **SIMPLE RESOLUTION**: Highest attack die wins, add bolster damage, subtract armor
4. **GUARD THEN VIGOUR**: Damage hits Guard first, excess goes to Vigour
5. **QUICK RECOVERY**: Guard fully restores after combat ends

++ COMBAT FLOW ++

**STEP 1: PLAYER ACTIONS**
- Players discuss their plan and declare actions in any order they wish
- Characters who were not readied for combat must pass CLA Save or miss this turn
- Ask what they want to do and with what weapons
- Players can coordinate and support each other

**STEP 2: NPC REACTIONS**
- NPCs react based on their nature, tactics, and player actions
- Decide their actions and targets based on the situation

**STEP 3: RESOLVE ATTACKS**
- All attackers targeting the same opponent roll their attack dice together
- Use the highest single die from all attackers
- Apply Gambits from dice of 4+ before taking the highest
- Add Bolster damage from other attackers (+1 per additional attacker)
- Subtract target's total Armor score
- Apply remaining damage

**STEP 4: RESOLVE DAMAGE**
- Damage goes to Guard (GD) first
- If Guard reaches exactly 0: Target gains a Scar
- If damage exceeds Guard: Excess goes to Vigour, target is Wounded
- If half or more remaining Vigour lost: Mortal Wound (down and dying)
- If Vigour reaches 0: Target is Slain

++ ATTACK RESOLUTION EXAMPLE ++
Knight with mace (d8) and shield (d4) attacks
Ally with 2 daggers (d6 each) helps
Roll: d8=7, d4=3, d6=1, d6=5
- Use 5 for Gambit (Bolster +1 damage), leaving highest die as 7
- Total damage: 7+1=8
- Target has 2 Armor (helm + shield): 8-2=6 damage
- Apply 6 damage to target's Guard first

++ THE THREE FEATS ++

**SMITE** - Release righteous fury
- Use before rolling a melee attack
- Attack gains either +d12 or Blast (hits everyone nearby)
- Pass VIG Save or become Fatigued

**FOCUS** - Create an opening
- Use after rolling an attack
- Perform one Gambit without using a die
- Pass CLA Save or become Fatigued

**DENY** - Rebuff an attack
- Use after an attack roll against you or nearby ally
- Discard one attack die from the roll
- Pass SPI Save or become Fatigued

++ GAMBITS (Using dice of 4+) ++
Attackers may discard attack dice of 4+ to perform these effects. Target gets VIG Save to ignore effect (except Bolster and Move):

- **Bolster**: +1 total damage per die spent (no save)
- **Move**: Move after attack even if already moved (no save)
- **Repel**: Push foe away from you (VIG Save to resist)
- **Stop**: Prevent foe from moving next turn (VIG Save to resist)
- **Impair**: Make foe's weapon Impaired next turn (VIG Save to resist)
- **Trap**: Lock foe's shield until your next turn (VIG Save to resist)
- **Dismount**: Knock foe off mount (VIG Save to resist)
- **Other**: Similar level effects at Referee discretion (VIG Save to resist)

**Strong Gambits** (dice of 8+ in melee): Choose one:
- **No Save**: Target gets no save against the Gambit effect
- **Greater Effect**: Disarm an item, break a wooden shield/weapon, remove a helm (does not increase Bolster damage)

++ SPECIAL COMBAT RULES ++

**FATIGUE**: After using a Feat, pass the relevant Save or become Fatigued (cannot use Feats until you rest)

**IMPAIRED ATTACKS**: Roll d4 only, cannot gain bonus dice or benefit from Feats

**BLAST ATTACKS**: Target everyone in area, roll separately for each

**EXPOSED**: Caught defenseless, treated as having 0 Guard

**DUELS**: Both combatants roll simultaneously, resolve at same time

++ DAMAGE AND CONDITIONS ++

**IMPORTANT**: Virtue Loss (from Scars, actions, etc.) CANNOT cause Mortal Wounds or Death. Only Damage can Mortally Wound or Slay.

**At VIG 0**: Exhausted (cannot attack if moved this turn)
**At CLA 0**: Exposed (treated as 0 Guard)  
**At SPI 0**: Attacks are Impaired (d4 only)

**Mortal Wounds**: Down and dying, die in 1 hour if untended, can be patched up quickly
**Scars**: Roll the die that caused the scar on the Scar table for permanent effects:

SCAR TABLE (Roll the die that caused the damage):
1. Distress - A lucky escape (Lose d6 SPI)
2. Disfigurement - A permanent mark (Roll d6: 1-Eye, 2-Cheek, 3-Neck, 4-Torso, 5-Nose, 6-Jaw. If max GD is 2 or less, increase by d6)
3. Smash - A sudden spray of blood (Lose d6 VIG)
4. Stun - Pain drowns the senses (Lose d6 CLA. If max GD is 4 or less, increase by d6)
5. Rupture - Innards pierced and compressed (Lose 2d6 VIG)
6. Gouge - Flesh torn from bone (When stitched up, if max GD is 6 or less, increase by d6)
7. Concussion - A heavy blow numbs the mind (Lose 2d6 CLA)
8. Tear - Something taken in violent struggle (Roll d6: 1-Nose, 2-Ear, 3-Finger, 4-Thumb, 5-Eye, 6-Scalp. When patched up, if max GD is 8 or less, increase by d6)
9. Agony - With a crack, a torturous break (Lose 2d6 SPI)
10. Mutilation - A limb rendered lost or useless (Roll d6: 1-2 Leg, 3-4 Shield Arm, 5-6 Sword Arm. By next Season get prosthetic, if max GD is 10 or less, increase by d6)
11. Doom - A cheated death haunts you (If you take Mortal Wound this Season, you are Slain instead)
12. Humiliation - A most dolorous stroke (When you achieve revenge, if max GD is 12 or less, increase by d6)

++ NARRATIVE COMBAT ++

1. **Player turn first** - "You have the initiative. Discuss your plan and tell me your actions."
2. **Handle surprise** - Characters unprepared for combat make CLA Saves
3. **Declare NPC reactions** - Based on their nature, tactics, and player actions
4. **Roll all attacks** - Players roll their dice, you roll for NPCs
5. **Resolve highest die + gambits + bolster - armor**
6. **Apply damage and describe results** - Vivid, consequence-driven narration
7. **Check for Scars/Wounds** - If Guard hits 0 or Vigour is damaged
8. **Continue until combat ends** - Guard restores, Fatigue clears

Remember: Combat is fast, brutal, and decisive. Focus on consequences and tactical choices rather than complex modifiers.
