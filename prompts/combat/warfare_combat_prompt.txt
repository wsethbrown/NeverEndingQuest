WARFARE COMBAT SYSTEM - MYTHIC BASTIONLAND
=========================================

This prompt provides detailed guidance for running Warfare scenarios where Knights lead or fight alongside Warbands in large-scale combat.

## WHEN TO USE WARFARE RULES

Use Warfare rules when:
- Knights are leading Warbands (groups of ~24 combatants)
- Conducting sieges against fortifications
- Naval battles with multiple ships
- Large-scale battles between armies
- Knights fighting alongside military units

Use REGULAR combat rules for individual Knights fighting alone or in small groups.

## WARFARE FLOW

### 1. Scale Assessment
First determine the scale of combat:
- **Individual Scale**: 1-6 combatants per side → Use regular combat
- **Warband Scale**: Groups of ~24 combatants → Use Warfare rules
- **Mixed Scale**: Individual Knights + Warbands → Use both systems

### 2. Command Structure
Identify leadership:
- **Knight Commanders**: Can lead Warbands and make tactical decisions
- **Leading from the Front**: Knights can add their dice to Warband attacks but take damage
- **Independent Knights**: Fight using regular combat rules even in large battles

### 3. Initiative and Actions
- **Knights act first** (as per regular rules)
- **Warbands act as single units** with their own initiative
- **Simultaneous resolution** for Warband vs Warband combat
- **Mixed combat**: Resolve Knight actions first, then Warband actions

## WARBAND COMBAT MECHANICS

### Attacking
- **Warband vs Warband**: Use Warband's weapon dice
- **Warband vs Individual**: Warband gets +d12 and causes Blast damage
- **Individual vs Warband**: Only effective if attack is Blast or "suitably large-scale"
- **Leading from Front**: Knight adds their attack dice to Warband's roll but takes same damage

### Taking Damage
- **Damage goes to Guard first**, then Vigour
- **At Guard 0**: Warband gains penalties but continues fighting
- **Mortally Wounded** (lose half+ remaining VIG): Warband is **routed** from battle
- **At VIG 0**: Warband is **wiped out entirely**
- **At SPI 0**: Warband is **broken** (won't follow orders, acts in self-interest)

### Morale and Spirit
- **Well-supplied Warbands**: Maintain SPI
- **Ill-rested, poorly fed, overworked**: Lose SPI over time
- **Broken Warbands** (SPI 0): Act only in self-interest, may flee or surrender
- **Witnessing allied Warbands routed**: May require SPI saves to avoid panic

## SIEGE WARFARE

### Fortification Stats
- **Gate**: 5GD, A2 (primary target for battering rams)
- **Rampart**: 10GD, A2 (earthwork defenses)
- **Castle Wall**: 10GD, A3 (cannot be breached conventionally - target the gate!)
- **Wooden structures**: Ignore attacks except fire, siege weapons, or large creatures

### Siege Equipment
- **Battering Ram**: d12 damage (vs gates and wooden structures)
- **Stone Thrower**: d12 blast damage (vs personnel and light structures)
- **Bolt Launcher**: 2d12 damage (precision shots vs individuals or weak points)
- **Trebuchet**: 3d12 blast damage, immobile (devastating vs structures and massed troops)
- **Siege Tower**: 7GD, A2 (mobile platform for scaling walls)

### Siege Tactics
- **Assault**: Direct attack on fortifications with siege equipment
- **Blockade**: Starve defenders (requires time, may cause SPI loss)
- **Infiltration**: Small groups attempt to open gates from inside
- **Undermining**: Tunnel under walls (specialized engineering)

## NAVAL WARFARE

### Ship Combat
- **Ships destroyed at 0GD**
- **Recovering GD takes a day of repairs**
- **Colliding ships**: Both take d12 damage (d6 if one much larger)
- **Ramming**: Deliberate collision for maximum damage

### Ship Types
- **Rowboat**: 4GD, carries 6 passengers (transport/scout)
- **Longship**: 7GD, A1, carries a Warband (raiding vessel)
- **Warship**: 10GD, A2, carries 2 Warbands (battle ship)

### Naval Tactics
- **Boarding**: Warbands fight on deck using normal Warfare rules
- **Ramming**: Ship collision damage
- **Artillery**: Siege weapons mounted on larger ships
- **Fire Ships**: Unmanned burning vessels sent at enemy fleet

## TACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Warband Types and Roles
- **Militia**: Cheap defenders, poor morale (SPI 7)
- **Skirmishers**: Mobile harassment, good for hit-and-run (CLA 13)
- **Mercenaries**: Reliable professionals with good armor (A3)
- **Riders**: Fast cavalry for flanking and pursuit (mounted, mobile)
- **Knights**: Elite heavy cavalry, excellent morale (SPI 13), all Feats

### Terrain Effects
- **Open ground**: Favors cavalry (Riders, Knights)
- **Rough terrain**: Favors infantry, impedes cavalry
- **Fortifications**: Provide defensive bonuses
- **Rivers/obstacles**: May split forces or provide defensive lines

### Weather and Conditions
- **Rain**: May affect archery (Skirmishers), reduce visibility
- **Mud**: Slows cavalry, makes maneuvering difficult
- **Night**: Reduces effectiveness, may cause confusion
- **Fog**: Limits ranged combat, enables surprise

## GLORY AND CONSEQUENCES

### Glory Awards for Warfare
- **Leading successful siege**: 3-5 Glory
- **Winning major battle**: 2-4 Glory
- **Saving routed Warband**: 1-2 Glory
- **Tactical brilliance**: 1-3 Glory (at Referee discretion)
- **Leading from front**: Additional Glory for personal risk

### Consequences of Defeat
- **Routed Warbands**: May desert or demand higher pay
- **Heavy losses**: Reduced recruitment in region
- **Failed sieges**: Enemy gains confidence, reinforcements arrive
- **Lost battles**: Territory may be lost, political consequences

## NARRATION GUIDELINES

### Describe Scale and Chaos
- Emphasize the noise, dust, and confusion of large battles
- Show the difference between individual heroics and mass combat
- Highlight moments where Knights stand out among the masses

### Focus on Leadership
- Knights making tactical decisions under pressure
- The weight of responsibility for soldiers' lives
- Moments where personal combat skills matter in larger context

### Consequences Matter
- Warbands that break or route have lasting effects
- Successful tactics should feel earned and impactful
- Failed strategies should have clear, logical consequences

Remember: Warfare in Mythic Bastionland is about Knights proving their leadership and tactical skill in large-scale conflicts. The focus should be on meaningful tactical choices and their consequences, not just rolling dice for big numbers.
