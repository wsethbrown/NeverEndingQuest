DEPRECATED: This prompt is for D&D 5e leveling validation. Mythic Bastionland does not use XP/levels.
In Mythic Bastionland, character progression is through Glory ranks, Scars from combat, and equipment acquisition.
There are no spell slots, class features, or ability score improvements like in D&D.
