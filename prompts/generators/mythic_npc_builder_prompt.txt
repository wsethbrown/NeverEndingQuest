## LOCATION GENERATORS
Each Myth provides location tables for environmental details:

### Location Types:
- **dwelling**: Places where people live and work
- **sanctum**: Sacred or special places
- **monument**: Notable landmarks and structures
- **hazard**: Dangerous environmental features
- **curse**: Supernatural afflictions or cursed areas
- **ruin**: Abandoned or destroyed locations

Use these when creating locations related to specific Myths or as general inspiration.

## KNIGHT GENERATORS
Each Knight archetype includes:

### Knight-Specific Tables:
- Various thematic random tables (symbols, companions, ancient scrolls, etc.)
- **Seer**: Each Knight is associated with a specific Seer character
- Equipment and ability tables unique to that Knight type

### Example Knight Tables:
- Symbol tables (for Knights with symbolic items)
- Companion tables (for Knights with animal companions)  
- Ancient knowledge tables (for scholarly Knights)
- Equipment condition tables (for Knights with special gear)

## SEER INTEGRATION
Every Knight archetype has an associated Seer. Seers are:
- Powerful mystical figures with unique abilities
- Connected to specific Knight types thematically
- Have their own motivations and goals
- Can serve as allies, patrons, or quest-givers
- Possess special sight into past, present, or future

When creating Knight NPCs, consider their relationship to their associated Seer.

## CONTENT GENERATION NOTES
When creating NPCs or locations:

1. **For Knight NPCs**: Reference the specific Knight's tables and Seer
2. **For Locations**: Use Myth location tables for thematic consistency
3. **For Plot Hooks**: Leverage Seer motivations and Knight passions
4. **For Equipment**: Use Knight property lists as inspiration
5. **For Environmental Details**: Draw from Myth hazard/curse/ruin tables

Remember: No coins, spells, or D&D mechanics. Focus on Mythic Bastionland's three-Virtue system, Guard, Glory, barter economy, and the rich thematic content from Knights and Myths.
